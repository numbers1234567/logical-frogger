# Logical Frogger

This is a variation on the normal game of Frogger. The key differences are: 

 1. The game is played exclusively on a river
 2. Each "log" on the river is represented as a point
 3. There is only 1 log per level on the river
 4. When the player can make a choice (switch logs or stay) then the game freezes until the player makes a decision
 5. The river is much wider than you would ever see in a normal game of Frogger
 6. Exact position and velocity values are given

This way, play is more focused on analysis and forward-thinking rather than timing. I want to implement an auto player which will always find the shortest possible time the game can be won.
